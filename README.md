##  1. <a name='ATTENTION'></a>ATTENTION

* The current TCOBSv1 code is stable and ready to use without limitations, but:
  * Encoding in **C** (for the embedded device).
  * Decoding in **Go** (for the PC side).
  * Further TCOBSv1 development is not planned. 
* The current TCOBSv2 code is stable and ready to use without limitations:
  * It is extensively tested but needs further testing.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
##  2. <a name='AboutTheproject'></a>About The project

![./TCOBSv1/docs/ref/COBSDataDisruption.svg](./TCOBSv1/docs/ref/COBSDataDisruption.svg)

* TCOBS is a variant of [COBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing) combined with real-time [RLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) data compression especially for short messages containing integers.
* The **consistent overhead** with TCOBS is 1 byte for each starting 31 bytes in the worst case, when no compression is possible. (*Example: A 1000 bytes buffer can be encoded with max 33 additional bytes.*) This is more compared to the original COBS with +1 byte for each starting 254 bytes but if the data contain integer numbers, as communication packets often do, the encoded data will be statistically shorter with TCOBS compared to the legacy COBS.

##  3. <a name='Preface'></a> Preface

* TCOBS was originally developed as an optional [*Trice*](https://github.com/rokath/trice) part and that's the **T** is standing for. It aims to reduce the binary [trice](https://github.com/rokath/trice) data together with framing in one step.
  * T symbols also the joining of the 2 orthogonal tasks compression and framing.
  * Additionally, the usage of ternary and quaternary numbers is reflected in the letter T.
* TCOBSv2 is a better approach for TCOBSv1, suited also when long sequences of equal characters occur in the data stream.
  * The TCOBSv1 compression is expected to be not that good as with TCOBS v2.
* About the data is assumed, that 00-bytes and FF-bytes occur a bit more often than other bytes.
* The compression aim is more to get a reasonable data reduction with minimal computing effort, than reducing to an absolute minimum. The method shown here simply counts repeated bytes and transforms them into shorter sequences. It works well also on very short messages, like 2 or 4 bytes and on very long buffers. The compressed buffer contains no 00-bytes anymore what is the aim of COBS. <!-- In the worst case, if no repeated bytes occur at all, the encoded data can be about 3% longer (1 byte per each 31 input bytes). -->
* **TCOBS is stand-alone usable in any project for package framing with data minimizing.**
* Use cases in mind are speed, limited bandwidth and long time data recording in the field.
* TCOBS is inspired by [rlercobs](https://docs.rs/kolben/0.0.3/kolben/rlercobs/index.html). The ending sigil byte idea comes from [rCOBS](https://github.com/Dirbaio/rcobs). It allows a straight forward encoding avoiding lookahead and makes this way the embedded device code simpler.
* TCOBS uses various chained sigil bytes to achieve an additional lossless compression if possible.
* Each encoded package ends with an sigil byte.
* `0` is usable as delimiter byte between the packages containing no `0` anymore. It is up to the user to insert the **optional** delimiters for framing after each or several packages.

###  3.1. <a name='Whynotin2steps'></a> Why not in 2 steps?

* Usually it is better to divide this task and do compression and COBS encoding separately. This is good if size and time do not really matter. 
* The for TCOBS expected messages are typically in the range of 2 to 300 bytes, but not limited, and a run-length encoding then makes sense for real-time compression.
* Separating compression and COBS costs more time (2 processing loops) and does not allow to squeeze out the last byte.
* With the TCOBS algorithm, in only one processing loop a smaller transfer packet size is expected, combined with more speed.

##  4. <a name='COBSDataDisruption'></a>COBS Data Disruption
  
* In case of data disruption, the receiver will wait for the next 0-delimiter byte. As a result it will get a packet start and end of 2 different packages A and Z.

  </a>

* For the COBS decoder it makes no difference if the COBS packages start or end with a sigil byte. In any case it will run into issues in such case with high probability. 
  * An additional package CRC before encoding could be added to decrease false match probability.
* The receiver calls continuously a `Read()` function. The received buffer can contain 0-delimited COBS packages and the receiver assumes them all to be valid because there is no known significant time delay between package start and end.
* If a package start was received and the next package end reception is more than ~100ms away, a data disruption is likely and the receiver should ignore these data.
  * To minimise data loss, each message should get COBS encoded separately.
* Of course, when the receiver starts, the first buffer can contain broken COBS data, but we have to live with that on a PC. Anyway there is a reasonable likelihood that the COBS decoder will detect a data inconsistency.
